# Connect your Airpods

Requirments:

1. The action need the command line tool [BluetoothConnector](https://github.com/lapfelix/BluetoothConnector). Make sure you have installed it.
2. Find your Airpods MAC address and fill it in the Python script of the action.
3. You may need to modify the Shebang line to your own Python path. There seems something wrong that LaunchBar can't find the `$PATH` variable correctly.
