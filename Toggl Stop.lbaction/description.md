# Stop Current Running Toggl Entry

This action is used to stop the current running toggl entry. Thanks to the module [TogglPy](https://github.com/matthewdowney/TogglPy), it's very easy.

The script dependencies or settings:

1. Python modules `TogglPy`.
2. Fill your Toggl account and password in the script.
3. If LaunchBar can't find your custom Python version even if you have changed the `$PATH` variable, you could modify the Shebang line to your own Python path. run `where python` to find your Python.
